                “One of the most empowering and therapeutic tools we have to
                eliminate stigma is telling and sharing stories. For many years,
                society has depended on victim blaming and silencing to cover up
                serious problems. Every story that is told erodes the protection
                that has been put up for far too long. Thank you so much for
                providing a secure space where people can speak up for their own
                healing as well as for all the other survivors out there who are
                feeling alone.”

                “My 6-year career has been spent listening to survivor stories.
                The frequency with which I hear "You are the first person I have
                ever told" when these stories are mentioned continues to amaze
                me. My eyes are watering just thinking about those things, and I
                want to shout, "Please don't back away! Nothing you did was
                wrong. You deserve to be loved, cared for, and healed. I am also
                aware of the strength of sharing those tales. It lessens our
                sense of isolation, dispels the humiliation, and enables others
                to show us the respect and love we deserve. Finally, studies
                demonstrate that even writing about our experiences—here or in a
                journal—changes how we perceive things and leads to healing.
                Many thanks (We Heal.)”
